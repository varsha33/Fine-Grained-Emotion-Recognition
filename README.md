# Fine-Grained Emotion Recognition

## Setup

### Data resources
Please download the following data from the given links, [EmpatheticDialogues](https://github.com/facebookresearch/EmpatheticDialogues/blob/master/LICENSE), [GoEmotions](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/goemotions), [Affect in Tweet](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/17751#learn_the_details-datasets) and [NRC VAD Lexicon](https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/nrc-vad.html)

Note: For EmpatheticDialogue dataset, please use ed_data_extract.py to transform the data before preprocessing. 

### Data preprocessing

For data preprocessing, run the following command

```
python preprocess.py
```
For training the model, go to config.py or config_multilabel.py to set the required parameters. 

The training for this work was done entirely in Google Colab due to resource requirements. Use kea_singlelabel_colab_notebook for single label setting and kea_multilabel_colab notebook for multilabel settings. 

### Alternative

Follow the below instructions to use the python scripts

```
python train.py ## for single-label settings
python train_multilabel.py ## for multi-label settings
```

## Requirements

Install the required packages mentioned in requirements.txt using pip.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
